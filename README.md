  Algorithms: genetic evolutionary learning


- The algorithms solve optimization problems by mimicking processes such as selection, crossover, and mutation.

- A GA begins with a random population of potential solutions.

- It uses a fitness function to evaluate and select the best solutions for reproduction.

- Crossover and mutation operators generate new solutions, or ‘offspring’.

- The algorithm iteratively improves the population towards an optimal solution.
